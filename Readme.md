# Soundbord

Viewable in action at [http://soundbord.co](http://soundbord.co).

I love the shows on the [5by5](http://5by5.tv) podcasting network, and felt that some of the sillier things that were said bore repeating. I also wanted to get more familiar with [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) and [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/). 

Hence, Soundbord. It's a pretty simple app. On the server it's a basic Sinatra app serving up a single html page. The front-end uses HTML 5 Boilerplate, and the [jplayer](http://jplayer.org/) jQuery plugin to actually play the audio. Jplayer is great because you don't have to know much about HTML audio to use it.

I downloaded all the shows manually and extracted clips with [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/). 

I'm open to requests for additional soundbites. If you have one, open an issue here, and pretty please add a timestamp and show number, so that I don't have to sift through hours of podcasts.
